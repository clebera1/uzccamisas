<h1> BeGreen Inventory üå± </h>

> Status: Developing

## It's a simple CRUD Project planned by me to make my Job at BeGreen easier.

### Overview üìù

In my job we have some issues that I wanted to solve, one of them is the difficult of make an inventory about all the products that are on the farm. In resume, we have to make a note of all of ours activitys and them, when we need to make the inventory of products we dont have a place where we can confer that notes, therefore we need to make all of our notes one more time, which make us lose our time and be less productive.
In this project I need some fields, which is:

+ id
+ benches
+ variety
+ allotment
+ amount

In addition to CRUD, I implement other features such as:

* See the more recently variety planted on a bench
* Search varietys by their name, date, allotment and/or benches

## Here is a practical explanation of what we do and why this project may help us:

1. In our farm we have more than 800m2 of productive area, with more than 40 benches, each one of them has around 650 holes ables to receive a vegetable which will grow in a period of 30 days by the day it was planted.

2. When we need to make the inventory of the farm we have to walk by this 800m2 and 40 benches, counting all the planted vegeteblas, deducting the "bad seeds" of the count and make an another apointement of: How much vegetables do we have, in which bench they are, their allotment and wheight.

3. With this CRUD we will point all the informations about the vegetables in the act, such as: Day, Variety, Bench, Allotment and Amount. We alredy do this in a Google Forms, and the informations go to a Google Sheets, which makes later consults way harder to be made.

4. And so, my point here is not to make something new, create or invent some new feature, it's just a way I find to improve what we alredy have.

Eventhough this makes our job easier, more productive and let us able to do more with less, it's not validate at all so that I need to hear another people of the Company and see what they think about it.
